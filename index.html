            <p class="lb-text"><span class="galaxy-name">The Andromeda Galaxy</span> is a spiral galaxy and is the nearest major galaxy to our own, the Milky Way.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> It was originally named the Andromeda Nebula before a debate between scientists settled that it was entirely another galaxy.</li>
                <li>It has a lot of similarities to the Milky Way, being both spiral galaxies.</li>
                <li>These galaxies resemble giant rotating pinwheels with a pancake-like disk of stars and a central bulge or tight concentration of stars.</li>

            <p class="lb-text"><span class="galaxy-name">The Milky Way</span> is our home galaxy. It's a spiral galaxy with a disk of stars spanning more than 100,000 light-years.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Earth, and by extension the entire Solar System, is located in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way, which is about halfway from the center.</li>
                <li>The Solar System is also orbiting the center of our galaxy once every 250 million years.</li>
                <li>Do you know that the <span class="blur-light">faint light</span> surrounding our galaxy is also a part of the galaxy itself? This part is called the halo, which is comprised of fewer stars, plasma gas, and even the enigmatic <span class="darkening">dark matter</span></li>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">NGC 1672 - Seyfert Galaxy</h2>
            <p class="lb-text"><span class="galaxy-name">NGC 1672</span> is another spiral galaxy. It's 60 million light-years away in the constellation Dorado. It's also a part of a group known as Seyfert galaxies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> A Seyfert galaxy is a type of active galaxy with a bright and energetic nucleus at the center</li>
                <li>It's powered by a black hole that is actively accreting matter. Because of this, the black hole has an enormous mass, which is billion times greater than our Sun's, hence the name <span class="massive">supermassive</span>.</li>
                <li>Seyfert galaxies are important to scientists because they provide insights about the evolution of the entire universe itself.</li>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">NGC 4150 - Elliptical Galaxy</h2>
            <p class="lb-text"><span class="galaxy-name">NGC 4150</span> is an example of elliptical galaxies. They look like a blurred out egg shape and lack features. Most other galaxies featured in this list, on the other hand, can be seen to have spiral structures.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This one in particular is about 45 million light years away from Earth. That means you are actually seeing its image from 45 million years ago because the update speed is not faster than light.</li>
                <li>Elliptical galaxies are comprised of older stars and they don't have much material to form new ones</li>
                <li>It's worth to mention lenticular galaxies, a hybrid between elliptical and spiral. These are disc shaped but without spiral arms.</li>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">The Interacting Antennae Galaxies</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">The <span class="galaxy-name">Antennae Galaxies</span> are a pair of galaxies that is currently undergoing a collision or merging event. Both are spiral galaxies but with irregular distortions due to the process.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When two spiral galaxies merge, they might become an elliptical or lenticular galaxy.</li>
                <li>Galactic collisions may look dramatic, but the chance that their stars actually collide are extremely low due to the vast distance between them</li>
                <li>In a few billion years from now, the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy will also undergo collision. Again, the stars themselves will hardly collide.</li>
